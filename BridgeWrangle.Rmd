main<- data.frame() # The empty location for the bridge data

for(i in 10:16){ # Loop through years 2010 through 16 (the only avail. urls for delimited data)

 dat <- read_csv(url, col_types = cols(RECORD_TYPE_005A = col_character(), DESIGN_LOAD_031 = col_character())) # Pull Bridge data from the url for the current, ith year
 reduced<- select(dat, 1:2, 13, 16,20:21,27,30,31,33:36,41,48:49,67:71, 73, 75,102  ) # Select our reduced set of variables for the current year
 year<-  rep(paste(20, i, sep =""), dim(dat)[1]) # Add the "year" column to the current dataframe
  reduced<- cbind(reduced, year)
 main<-rbind(main, reduced) # Add the current year's data to the overall dataframe
}

# Now we have main, a dataframe with PR from 2010 to 2016
# Changing PR to a different territory brings about different parsing errors which should be attended to similarly
